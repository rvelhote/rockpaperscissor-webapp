# Rock Paper Scissors Webapp

This project will create Rock Paper Scissors games to play with the world. The main goal is to make use of the library 
that was created to support such games.

Not only I wish to support the classic game but also [variations](http://www.umop.com/rps.htm) with different moves and 
strategies.

It will be mostly an experiment to learn new technologies and frameworks. My plan is to use Symfony3 for the backend 
and ReactJS for the frontend. Symfony is quite heavy but the goal is to learn something new that I can use in bigger 
projects later on.

**Planned features**

- [ ] Consult Twitter feeds for hashtags to feed a database of challenges
- [ ] Play games automatically (hashtags vs hashtags) to keep the platform going and generating results
- [ ] Allow users to play against stored challenges
- [ ] Registration and reclaim Twitter accounts (by authenticating with it)
- [ ] Watch games being played in realtime
- [ ] View leaderboards and watch them get updated as games progress
